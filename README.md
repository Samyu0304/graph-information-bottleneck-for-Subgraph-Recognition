# graph-information-bottleneck-for-subgraph-recognition
Code for the paper "Graph Information Bottleneck for Subgraph Recognition" in ICLR 2021.
Something important: there is a MI_est function where I implement multiple estimators in trian_eval.py of graph classfication task. Please use Donsker-varadhan estimator as recommended in our paper instead of the last one.
